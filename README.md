# sensor-samples

This is a set of Arduino sketch files with sample code to access a whole bunch
of different sensors that came in the
[DDR47 PCB DIY Sensor / Module Set for Arduino + Raspberry Pi - Multicolored](http://www.dx.com/p/ddr47-pcb-diy-arduino-raspberry-pi-sensor-module-set-multicolored-277221#.Vb2yMpNHulM) package.  The set was donated to WCRS, along with the code that came from various existing samples and tweaks.

A spreadsheet is included in the repository, in both Excel (.xls) and Open Office (.ods) formats with an inventory of what the package contained.  The product parts list description was a bit vague, and the packing information non-existant.
